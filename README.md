# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three independent projects demonstrating different machine learning and deep learning techniques using Python.

## **Task 1: Time Series Analysis**
**Description:**  
Analyze and model time-series data to forecast future values (e.g., stock prices, sales).

**Key Steps:**  
- Load and preprocess the dataset.  
- Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.  
- Implement moving average and exponential smoothing techniques.  
- Build an ARIMA/SARIMA model for forecasting.  
- Evaluate the model using RMSE and visualize the forecasts.  

**Tools:**  
Python, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib

## **Task 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text Classification**
**Description:**  
Classify text data into categories such as sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

**Key Steps:**  
- Preprocess text data (tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization).  
- Convert text to numerical representation using TF-IDF.  
- Train classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).  
- Evaluate models using precision, recall, and F1-score.  

**Tools:**  
Python, nltk, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib  



## **Task 3: Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras**
**Description:**  
Build and train a feed-forward neural network for image or structured data classification.

**Key Steps:**  
- Load and preprocess dataset (e.g., MNIST or CSV structured data).  
- Design a neural network architecture using Keras.  
- Train the model using backpropagation.  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss curves.  
- Tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) to improve performance.  

**Tools:**  
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, matplotlib
